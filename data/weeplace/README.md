## Description from Zenodo

Weeplaces: "weeplace_checkins.csv" and "weeplace_friends.csv"

Weeplaces --This is collected from Weeplaces and integrated with the APIs of other LBSN services, e.g., Facebook Places, Foursquare, and Gowalla. Users can login Weeplaces using their LBSN accounts and connect with their social ties in the same LBSN who have also used this application. Weeplaces visualizes your check-ins on a map. Unlike Gowalla, there is no direct incentive in Weeplaces to alter one's visitation habits or check-ins, so there should be a more accurate representation of a regular person's mobility patterns.
The raw dataset is from the website https://www.yongliu.org/datasets/.
