# Reverse-engineering the observation area of the 'YJMob100K' data

## Usage

The [`pyproject.toml`](pyproject.toml) document the required dependencies. It's suggested to use the [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) packaging tool. In this case, just issue the `poetry install` command to set up a virtual environment with all the necessary dependencies.

After the development environment has set up, run the notebooks in the following order to reproduce the results.

1. [plot_heatmaps.ipynb](src/plot_heatmaps.ipynb)
    - this will reproduce the heatmaps [Figure 6] from the [data description paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.03401),
    - do the inverse-transformed plots, and
    - some related plots for the paper
2. [generate_grid.ipnyb](src/generate_grid.ipynb)
   - this will locate the observation area within Japan and generate the grid

These two notebooks contain the main work. The [detect_homes.ipynb](src/detect_homes.ipynb), [validate_home_detection.ipynb](src/validate_home_detection.ipynb), [calculate_grid_complexity.ipynb](src/calculate_grid_complexity.ipynb), and the [src/plot_grid.ipynb](src/plot_grid.ipynb) are optional steps to reproduce the figure in the technical validation section of the paper.

### Upscaling grid

- [Upscale heatmap as a template](scale_grid.ipynb)
    - merges the neighboring cells while summing the activity in the four cells resulting lower resolution template heatmaps
- [Locate upscaled observation area](locate_rescaled_observation_area.ipynb)
    - plots the land area of the selected six prefectures proportionally to the upscaled heatmap (grid) and applies template matching

### Other cities

1. [Helsinki](src/helsinki.ipynb)
    - the Helsinki notebook processes the data for different grid sizes in one run
2. [London](src/london.ipynb)
    - `rx` and `ry` parameters are for the grid size, use either 500, 1000, 2000, or 4000
3. [Toronto](src/london.ipynb)
    - it is the same notebook as for London, because the dataset is the same
    - enable the Toronto parameter block
4. [Dallas--Fort Worth](src/dallas.ipynb)
    - `RES` parameter is for the H3 resolution, vales between 6 and 10 were applied

### User identifiability

A user is considered k-identifiable if the most frequently visited k location are distinguishable [^zang2011anonymization].
The top four location have been determined for every user, then the grid cell were upscaled to 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16 km.

The following table compares the top-four-location identifiable users by upscaled grids.
The relevant notebook is [here](src/top_cell_identifiability.ipynb).

|   distinguishable cells |   1 km x 1 km |   2 km x 2 km |   4 km x 4 km |   8 km x 8 km |   16 km x 16 km |
|------------------------:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|--------------:|----------------:|
|                       4 |         35469 |         12882 |          5090 |          1810 |             470 |
|                       3 |         48228 |         42323 |         28457 |         16752 |            7438 |
|                       2 |         15582 |         38548 |         50987 |         52608 |           44939 |
|                       1 |           721 |          6247 |         15466 |         28830 |           47153 |

## Results

The results are included to be available without executing the code.
Most notably, the [reproduced grid](output/grid_bl_2449.geojson) (in [EPSG:2449](https://spatialreference.org/ref/epsg/2449/) projection).

### Choropleth maps using the reproduced grid

The spatial distribution of the activity (first) and the number of unique users (second) per cell using the reproduced grid.
